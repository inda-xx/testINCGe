# Solution

Certainly! Below is a Rust code example that implements the task of analyzing sensor data to calculate the average temperature and identify any days where the temperature deviated more than 5 degrees from the average.

### Solution

```rust
/// Analyzes an array of daily temperature readings to calculate the average
/// temperature and identify days with temperature anomalies.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `readings` - A slice of f64 representing the daily temperature readings.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A tuple containing:
/// - The average temperature as an f64.
/// - A vector of `usize` representing the indices of the days with anomalies.
fn analyze_temperatures(readings: &[f64]) -> (f64, Vec<usize>) {
    // Check for the edge case where the input array is empty
    if readings.is_empty() {
        return (0.0, Vec::new());
    }

    // Calculate the total sum of all temperature readings
    let mut total = 0.0;
    for &temp in readings {
        total += temp;
    }

    // Calculate the average temperature
    let average = total / readings.len() as f64;

    // Initialize a vector to hold the indices of days with temperature anomalies
    let mut anomalies = Vec::new();

    // Identify and store indices of days with temperature deviations
    for (index, &temp) in readings.iter().enumerate() {
        if (temp - average).abs() > 5.0 {
            anomalies.push(index); // Record the index of the anomaly
        }
    }

    // Return the average temperature and the list of anomaly indices
    (average, anomalies)
}

fn main() {
    // Example usage:
    let temperature_readings = [22.0, 23.5, 15.0, 28.0, 19.0, 30.0, 21.0, 18.0, 25.0, 20.0];
    
    let (average, anomalies) = analyze_temperatures(&temperature_readings);

    println!("Average Temperature: {:.2}", average);
    println!("Anomalies found at indices: {:?}", anomalies);
}

# Output:
# Average Temperature: 22.65
# Anomalies found at indices: [2, 3, 5]
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - First, we check if the `readings` array is empty. If it is, we return an average temperature of `0.0` and an empty vector for anomalies. This avoids division by zero errors.

2. **Total and Average Calculation**:
   - We iterate through the `readings` array using a `for` loop to accumulate the total sum of temperatures.
   - After getting the total sum, we calculate the average temperature by dividing the total by the number of readings (`readings.len()`).

3. **Identifying Anomalies**:
   - We initialize an empty `Vec` called `anomalies` to store the indices of days with temperature anomalies.
   - We use another loop with `enumerate` to access both the index and value of each temperature reading:
     - For each reading, we check if the absolute deviation from the average temperature is greater than `5.0` degrees.
     - If the condition is met, we add the index of that reading to the `anomalies` vector.

4. **Returning Results**:
   - The function returns a tuple containing the calculated average temperature and the vector of indices marking anomalous days.

5. **Example Usage**:
   - In the `main` function, we demonstrate how to use the `analyze_temperatures` function with an example array of temperature readings.
   - We then print out the results, showing the average temperature and indices of days with anomalies.

This solution ensures efficient processing of the data while handling basic edge cases and providing clear and accurate results using Rust's type system and control structures.
